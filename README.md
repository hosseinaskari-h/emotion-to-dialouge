# emotion-to-dialouge
This project uses webcam feeds and facial emotion recognition to dynamically present dialogues reflective of the viewer's most prominent emotion. 
Utilizing the ml5.js library for real-time facial emotion detection, this installation selects relevant dialogues from the emotion-classified "DailyDialog" dataset. 
The output is an overlay of text on the viewer's video feed, offering a personalized reflection of emotional states through digital interaction.
